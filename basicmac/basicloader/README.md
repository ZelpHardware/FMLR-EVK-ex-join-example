# Basic Loader

Basic Loader is an update-capable bootloader that supports the unpacking and
installing of new firmware on an end-device.

Basic MAC uses this component to load its firmware, and to support firmware
updates over-the-air (FUOTA).

## Building Basic Loader

The reference hardware platform for Basic Loader is the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 STM32
LoRaâ„¢ Discovery kit.

### Prerequisites
It is recommended to use a recent Ubuntu distribution as build host with the
`gcc-arm-embedded` package installed.

To build the bootloaders for all supported platforms, simply run `make` in
the toplevel directory.

Alternatively, change into a specific target board's build directory and run
`make` there:

```
cd build/boards/B-L072Z-LRWAN1
make
```

The output of the build process is a file named `bootloader.hex` that can be
loaded onto the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 development board. If there is no valid firmware
installed, the LED LD2 will be flashing the corresponding error sequence
(SYNC-2-2-1).
